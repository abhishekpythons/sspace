## Introduction:  
- This subsystem helps you in setting of connection between Ground station and Satellite. 
- It consists of two important links: Uplink and Downlink. 
- The communication links are also used for tracking the spacecraft by measuring the angular position of the downlink signal by Doppler measurements and by ranging or two-way Doppler. 

## Design Challenges: 
The telecommunication challenges for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions vs. deep space missions are very different. 

- In LEO, ground-antenna gain can compensate for limited onboard antenna gain and radio power and CubeSats can manage limitations of power generation and thermal dissipation by duty-cycling high-power components.] 
- Most LEO CubeSats rely on UHF and/or S-band radios to receive commands or transmit telemetry back to Earth’s ground station. There are only few radios available at X-band or Ka-band.  
- Antenna Design for CubeSats is major challenge. 
- X/ Ka band Communication Board design is another challenge to work on. 
- Noise and Interference accommodation while designing is major challenge. 

## Components of Communication Subsystem:  

### 1. Link Budget Design:
- Link Budget is accounting of all the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium (free space, cable, waveguide, Fiber, etc.) to the receiver in a telecommunication system.  
- It accounts for the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as the antenna gains, feedline, and miscellaneous losses. 
- A simple link budget equation looks like this:  
    Received Power (dB) = Transmitted Power (dB) + Gains (dB) − Losses (dB)

### 2. Communication Board Design: 
- It consists of selection of different components for Transmitter and Receiver design. 
- Shown below typical ground Receiver schematic. 
- Selection of  Power Amplifier, IC, Band in which we are going to transmit, etc while designing this board is important step to keep in mind.

### 3. Antenna Design: 
- Existing antenna technologies for CubeSats, we will classify them in the following categories: LGAs (<8dBi)-Low Gain Antennas, MGAs (<25dBi)-Medium Gain Antennas and high-gain antennas (>25 dBi). 
- Usually CubeSats mission uses dipole, Microstrip Patch Antennas. 
- New concept of Antennas are Foldable antennas based on ORIGAMI concept.
